## Creating a Drafting Object
The methods for creating all drafting objects apply in the same manner. These instructions apply to creating 2D lines, copper, copper cutouts, board outlines, board outline cutouts, keepouts, copper planes, and copper plane cut outs.

**Procedure**

- 1. After you click a button on the Drafting Toolbar, right-click to set any values before creating the drafting objecton page 614.
- 2. Right-click and choose any of the following shapes to draw from the popup menu.
- Circleon page 624
- Polygon or Pathon page 623
- Rectangleon page 624
- Chamfered pathon page 656 (copper only)

## Set Values Before Creating a Drafting Object
Use the Drafting Toolbar to add drafting objects, such as copper shapes, keepouts, and non-electrical drawn items generally not associated with placement and routing. You can set various values after you click the button for the type of item to add, but before you place the drafting object.

**Set Line Width**

Choose one of the following methods to set the width of the lines in the drafting object you are creating:

- Type W<nn>, where <nn> is the width value
- Right-click and click the **Width** popup menu item and type a value.
- Set the Default width value in the Text and Lines options on page 1553.

**Set Line Style**

For 2D lines only, choose one of the following methods to set the line style:

- Right-click and click the **Line Style** popup menu item, then choose a line style from the list.
- Type one of the LS Modeless Commandsto set the line style.

**Set Layer Placement**

Choose one of the following methods to select the layer for the placement of your drafting object:

- Type L<n>, where <n> is a layer number
- Right-click and click the **Layer** popup menu item to specify the layer where you want to place the Drafting object.
- Specify the layer using the Layer list on the Standard Toolbar.

**Set Auto Mitering of Corners**

Choose one of the following methods to auto miter corners (diagonal miter or arc):

- Right-click and click the **Auto Miter** popup menu item to miter all added corners. Define the miter type and size in the Design optionson page 1503.
- In the Design optionson page 1503 in the Miters area, select the Auto miter check box.

**Set Snap to Objects**

You can snap to existing objects instead of to locations on the design grid. You can begin drawing from an object snap point or draw to an object snap point. You can enable snapping to objects in the Object Snap Optionson page 1540 or on the popup menu while drawing drafting objects. You can also use the OS Modeless Commands.

• Right-click and click the **Snap to Objects** popup menu item.

## Edge Precision of Drafting Shapes
You often need to precisely control the edge of drafting shapes, as many factors contribute to that edge.

**Line Width**

The precision of edges is controlled by the line width used to create the shape. The default line width is set on the **Text and Lines** category of the Options dialog box. However, you can change the line width prior to, or after creating your shape. Use a very narrow outline width to achieve a sharp corner or increase the value for more blunt corners. All corners are rounded with a radius equal to one half of the outline width.

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_3_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Design and Hatch Grids**

Lines are used to create the outline of the shape and are also used to create the fill inside electrical drafting items. Lines or outlines are placed on the design grid. Then shapes are filled using horizontal lines placed on the Hatch Grid.

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_3_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_3_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Clearance Rules**

If you are creating a copper plane and your drafting shape is near another object, the resulting poured outline could be displaced by the clearance rules of that object.

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 68. Clearance Rule Effect on the Hatch Outline**

## The Fill of Copper, and Copper Planes
SailWind Layout generates the fill of copper and copper plane shapes using drafting lines drawn on the copper hatch grid. If you create the shape using a line width value less than the copper hatch grid value, it results in a hatch pattern. If you use a line width value equal to, or greater than the copper grid value, it results in a solid copper shape.

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_4_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Figure 69. Example of Solid and Hatch Pattern**

Shapes can be flooded with copper in varying degrees of hatch through to a solid pattern. The pattern used by default when you flood a shape is determined by the relative values of two settings in the Options dialog box:

- The Default width value on the Drafting / Text and Lines options category on page 1553
- The Copper hatch grid value on the Grids options categoryon page 1537

You can set line width and grid settings before or after creating the object. After you've drawn the shape, you can change the settings in the Drafting Propertieson page 1328. If you need to customize the copper hatch grid for a copper plane shape, you can set the grid value in the Flood on page 1381.

<span id="page-5-0"></span>For more information on creating shapes with the desired flood pattern, see Creating a Copper Shape and "Creating a Copper Plane Manually"on page 667.

## Migration to Copper Planes
Prior to the VX.2.4 release, SailWind Layout used copper pours on "No Plane" layers and plane areas on "Split/mixed" layers. For all later releases, the software unifies copper pours and plane areas into "copper planes." If you open a design saved in an earlier version, PADS migrates or converts all copper pours and plane areas to copper planes and applies design rules accordingly. Certain clearance and connectivity changes in your design may result.

The following changes take place during the migration to copper planes:

- The "Remove unused pads" setting, found in the "Thermals Options"on page 1514, is extended to "No Plane" layers. With this setting enabled, all pads are removed on all internal "No Plane" and "Split/Mixed" layers unless the pin is connected to a trace or a copper plane on that layer. Prior to the PADS VX.2.4 release, unused pads were removed only from "Split/Mixed" layers.
- Copper pours converted to copper planes are affected by the Plane Thermal check box (in the Pin, or Via Properties dialog boxes) on page 797. Prior to PADS VX.2.4, the setting applied only to plane areas on "Split/Mixed" layers. This means, for example, if you have disabled thermal connections for a pad or via by clearing the "Plane Thermal" check box, the software removes the thermal connection to copper planes (old copper pours) on "No Plane" layers when you import the design into a newer release.
- You can apply custom thermals and custom antipads to copper planes on "No Plane" layers in addition to "Split/Mixed" layers. Prior to PADS VX.2.4, the custom thermals and antipads applied only to plane areas on "Split/Mixed" layers.
- Prior to PADS VX.2.4, a pin could receive a thermal connection to a plane area on a "Split/Mixed" layer even though a trace was connected to it. With later releases, any component pin with an attached trace does not receive a thermal connection if the "Add thermals to routed component pads" setting is disabled in the "Thermals Options"on page 1514. This was already the case for copper pours beginning with the PADS VX.2.3 release, and has been extended to copper planes on "Split/Mixed" layers in subsequent releases. Prior to PADS VX.2.3, a pin could receive a thermal connection to a copper pour even though a trace was connected and the "Add thermals to routed component pads" setting was disabled if an additional unrouted pin pair connection existed on the pin. Via pads will still receive thermal connections to copper planes regardless of the setting.
- The plane indicators, previously only shown on "Split/Mixed" layers and "CAM Plane" layers are extended to pins and vias surrounded by a copper plane on "No Plane" layers. The Show general copper plane indicators setting is found in the "Thermals Options"on page 1514.
- One smoothing radius setting in the "Hatch and Flood Options"on page 1511 applies to all copper planes, regardless of the layer on which they reside. Previous releases had separate smoothing radius settings for copper pours and plane areas. The value from the Hatch and Flood of an existing design is retained in VX.2.4 and later releases. It may be necessary to adjust the smoothing radius value if you experience connectivity errors in a later release that were not present in the prior version.
- The setting "Remove violating thermal spokes" is removed. All violating thermals spokes are removed by default. This is a hard-coded setting that cannot be modified.
- The modeless command "PO" toggles copper planes between pour outline and the flooded hatch display. The "SPO", "SPI", and "SPD" commands are no longer used.
- The "Create cutouts around embedded planes" setting in the "Hatch and Flood Options"on page 1511 works for "No Plane" layers in addition to "Split/Mixed" layers. Previously, that setting worked for only "Split/Mixed" layers.
- Starting with VX.2.3, copper floods to the inner edge of completed cut out outlines instead of the centerline. Prior to VX.2.3, the cut out would grow by half the line width since copper would flood to its centerline rather than the inner edge which was the intended boundary. For more information, see "Creating a Copper Plane Cut Out"on page 686.

**Figure 70. Cut Out Pour Boundary Changes**

• Beginning with PADS VX.2.6, the origin of the copper plane hatch grid is calculated from the lower left corner (if one exists or calculated if one does not exist) of the pre-flooded shape. If you used a hatched fill instead of a solid fill in a pre-VX.2.6 design, the hatch grid might not have the same origin and placement of the lines of the hatch grid. As a result, pins or vias that touched and connected to the hatch grid might not be connected. Other pins that did not touch or connect to the hatch grid might be in a position to connect.

The origin of the hatch grid pattern is defined by an imaginary box surrounding the extents of the copper plane shape. The extents box is reduced by ½ the line width of the copper plane shape and the hatch grid origin is placed in the lower left corner of the extents box. For a simple rectangular copper plane shape the hatch grid origin will be in the lower left corner of the shape. For more complex shapes, the lower left corner of the extents may be a point outside of the copper plane shape. This is not the origin of the copper plane shape, only the origin of the hatch pattern for the copper plane.

## Plane and Net Connectivity
A *plane* is a large copper area that provides access to universally necessary nets, like power or ground. One design may use several plane areas.

Most PCB designs locate planes on inner layers that are dedicated to the plane only, although you can place them on outer layers. The plane area can occupy all or only part of the layer.

Copper planes may have insulated traces and vias passing across the plane area, as long as the traces do not divide the plane to break connectivity.

Pins that are supposed to connect to the plane are usually plotted for manufacturing using spoked thermal relief pads. Pins that do not connect to the plane are referred to as unused pads, and are typically removed from inner layer planes and replaced with antipads.

Establishing a plane area and connecting the appropriate nets to it is usually one of the first routing tasks in the design process. The following two methods establish plane areas:

- Define a Layer as a Split/Mixed type and draw a Copper Plane
- Draw a Copper Plane on a No Plane layer

**Displaying Connectivity with General Plane Indicators**

Use the "Show general copper plane indicators" setting in the **Copper Planes** category > **Thermals**  subcategory of the Options dialog box to see which pins have thermals. The "Plane thermal" Pin Properties setting determines whether the thermal is generated for the pin.

Set the Plane Thermal option using the Properties dialog boxes for pins, vias, and jumper pins.

**Tip**

Copper Planes on a No Plane or Split/Mixed layer are functionally equivalent. Using a Split/Mixed layer provides the "Show plane nets only" check box in the Drafting Properties and use of the Plane check in Verify Design. Some other software tools may make use of a layer specifically set as Split/Mixed to utilize certain functions.

## Creating a Polygon or Path Drafting Object
Use the Drafting Toolbar to add drafting objects such as copper shapes, keepouts, and non-electrical drawn items generally not associated with placement and routing.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the button for the type of item to add: **2D Line**, **Copper**, **Copper Cut Out**, **Keepout**, **Copper Plane**, **Copper Plane Cut Out** or **Board Outline and Cut Out**. The add command for that object type attaches to your pointer.
- 2. Right-click and set your drafting valueson page 614.
- 3. To start the drafting object and finish each segment or place each corner, use one of the following:
	- Locate each coordinate with the pointer, and click to start and indicate consecutive corners.
	- Type S<x>, <y>, where <x> and <y> are the coordinate values for the starting point and consecutive corners.
	- Type SR<x>, <y> if you want to specify relative coordinate values for each point and corner.

**Tip** Right-click and click the **Add Arc** popup menu item to add an arc instead of a straightline segment.

## Self-Intersecting Polygons
A *self-intersecting polygon* occurs whenever a portion of a shape outline overlaps with another portion of the same shape. In some cases, creating a polygon with too large a line width for the outline can also cause overlapping of some portions.

When drafting copper planes and shapes using polygons, you can set the outline line width in the Drafting Properties Dialog Box. Choosing a narrow line width enables you to create shapes with greater accuracy in detailed areas, as shown below.

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_13_Figure_1.jpeg)

You can set the line width as required for your design; however, as the width increases, the shape resolution decreases. Referring to the example in the preceding figure, as the outline line width of a copper shape increases, the outer edge of the lines remain in place and the inner edges expand inward. The result appears in the figure below.

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_14_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 74. Shape Detail with Increased Line Width**

If you set the outline line width too wide, the centerlines of two edge segments may overlap one another, resulting in a self-intersection polygon.

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_15_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 75. Overlapping Centerlines**

**Note:**

The overlap is most visible when you turn on copper flooding.

Keep in mind that a self-intersecting polygon can occur with planes created from the board outline shape when the plane area shrinks by the clearance value. Similarly, a self-intersecting polygon can also occur when using the auto separate functionality because of the auto separate gap.

## Text
Use free text to add text information to your design. Free text is not associated to a particular design object; you can use it to add descriptions such as board identification nomenclature.

### Adding Free Text
You can add single lines of free text (text not belonging to an object) to a design.

When you add text, there is an invisible bounding rectangle on page 1813 or outline box around the text itself. Type the X modeless command to toggle the outline box on or off.

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_16_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Tip** To add multiple lines of text to a design, see "Embedded Text Documents on page 986".

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Drafting Toolbar** button to open the Drafting Toolbar, and then click the **Text** button.
- 2. In the Add Free Text Dialog Box, type the text string you want to use in the Text box. There is a maximum of 128 characters per text string.
- 3. In the Font list, select the font you want to use. The default font name and style appear in the Font box when the dialog box opens. Select a stroke font or a system font.

![](/layout/guide/27/_page_16_Picture_13.jpeg)

**Tip** For system fonts, you can also click a font style button or any combination of buttons: **B** for bold, **I** for italic, or **U** for underlined.

- 4. In the Layer list, select the layer on which you want the text.
- 5. In the X,Y location boxes, type values to move the text string to a specified location. If not specified, the text string attaches to your pointer for placement.
- 6. The Rotation box shows the current orientation of the text string. Type a new value to change the degree of rotation.
- 7. The Size box shows the current size used for display or CAM output of the text string. Type a new value to change the size.
- 8. For stroke font, type a line width.
- 9. Select the Mirrored check box if you want to flip the text. When Mirrored is checked, text is considered readable from the bottom side of the board.
- 10. In the Justification area, set the horizontal and vertical justification of the text to ensure proper positioning between objects when text, attribute values, size, or width change.
	- For vertical justification, click **Left**, **Center**, or **Right**.
	- For horizontal justification, choose **Up**, **Center**, or **Down**.

**Tip**

You can set justification in the design after closing the Add Free Text dialog box. Select the text, then right-click and click **Justify Horizontally**, and then click the **Left**, **Center**, or **Right** popup menu item; and right-click and click **Justify Vertically,** and then click the **Up**, **Center**, or **Down** popup menu item.

11. Click **OK** to close the dialog box. If you did not type coordinates to place the text, the text dynamically attaches to the pointer. Click to indicate the location for the text. After you place the text, the Add Free Text dialog box reappears so you can create additional strings.
