## Electrical Net Creation
You can associate an array of nets joined by discrete components, creating an electrical net to which you can apply length, differential pair and matched length rules as you would to a single net. The length of an electrical net is the combined lengths of the nets and discrete components of which it is composed.

The figure below shows a simple example of an electrical net.

There are three methods you can use to create and modify electrical nets.

By default these methods are independent of each other (that is, you can use any of the methods by itself), because the commands/properties by which they interact are defaulted to allow you to choose one method to use, and ignore the others. Choosing one method and sticking with it is the simplest course. If you mix methods in your design, you will need to understand how the methods interact, described in ["Conditions Governing Electrical Net Creation"on page 348](#page-11-0).

### Creating Electrical Nets by Selecting the Nets
You can create electrical nets by selecting nets and associating them.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- Plane nets cannot be part of an electrical net.
- Components through which an electrical net passes must be either discrete two-pin components, or multiple pin components if all the pins connect to a gate and each gate has exactly two pins.

- 1. Click the **Setup> Electrical Nets** menu item.
- 2. In the Electrical Netson page 1361 dialog box, set the "Maximum net count per electrical net" and "Maximum non-plane-net pin count" values for your design.
- 3. In the workspace, select the nets you want make into electrical nets.
- 4. Right-click and click the **Electrical Nets** popup menu item. As an alternative, in the Net Properties dialog boxon page 1487, select the "Create electrical net" check box. The selected nets are made into electrical nets, and the Net Properties "Create electrical net" check box is selected for all the selected nets.
- 5. Whenever electrical nets are created, deleted or changed, all electrical nets in the design are regenerated. Verify that the results of an electrical nets action are what you expected by reading the messages in the Output Window.

**Results**

Are the results different from what you expected?:

- An expected electrical net might have been split or truncated, or not created at all, if it surpassed one of the maximum thresholds set in the Electrical Netson page 1361 dialog box.
- Some nets cannot be made into electrical nets; for example, two selected nets from opposite sides of the board will have the Create electrical net check box selected, but no electrical net will be created.
- Mixed-method restriction if a component to which one of the selected nets is attached has been excluded from electrical net creation, no electrical net can go through it. (A component or net is excluded from electrical net creation if its "Create electrical nets" and "Allow electrical net creation..." check boxes are both cleared.) For more information, see [""Conditions Governing](#page-11-0)  [Electrical Net Creation"on page 348](#page-11-0)".

### Creating Electrical Nets by Selecting the Components
To base the creation of electrical nets on the selected components, use the connected physical nets on the components to create your electrical nets.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- Plane nets cannot be part of an electrical net.
- Components through which an electrical net passes must be either discrete two-pin components, or multiple pin components if all the pins connect to a gate and each gate has exactly two pins.

- 1. Click the **Setup> Electrical Nets** menu item.
- 2. In the Electrical Netson page 1361 dialog box, set the "Maximum net count per electrical net" and "Maximum non-plane-net pin count" values for your design.
- 3. In the workspace, select the components whose nets you want to make into an electrical net.
- 4. Right-click and click the **Electrical Nets** popup menu item. As an alternative, in the Component Properties Dialog Box, select the "Create electrical net" check box. The nets attached to the selected components are made into an electrical net, and the Component Properties "Create electrical net" property is set for all the selected components.
- 5. Whenever electrical nets are created, deleted or changed, all electrical nets in the design are regenerated. Verify that the results of an electrical nets action are what you expected by reading the messages in the Output Window.

**Results**

Are the results different from what you expected?

- An expected electrical net might have been split or truncated, or not created at all, if it surpassed one of the maximum thresholds set in the Electrical Netson page 1361 dialog box.
- Mixed-method restriction if a net attached to a selected component is excluded from electrical net creation, it cannot be included in an electrical net. (A component or net is excluded from electrical net creation if its "Create electrical net" and "Allow electrical net creation..." check boxes are both cleared.) For more information, see ["Conditions Governing Electrical Net Creation"on](#page-11-0) [page 348.](#page-11-0)

### Creating Electrical Nets by Component Refdes Prefix
You can create electrical nets automatically by specifying the refdes prefixes of the components through which the nets pass in the Electrical Nets dialog box.

For more information, see Electrical Nets Dialog Box.

**Restrictions and Limitations**

- Plane nets cannot be part of an electrical net.
- Components through which an electrical net passes must be either discrete two-pin components, or multiple pin components if all the pins connect to a gate and each gate has exactly two pins.

- 1. Click the **Setup> Electrical Nets** menu item.
- 2. In the Electrical Netson page 1361 dialog box, set the "Maximum net count per electrical net" and "Maximum non-plane-net pin count" values for your design.
- 3. In the "Discrete component prefixes" area, enter the refdes prefixes of the components that should create electrical nets. This creates electrical nets for all components that have the specified refdes prefixes. In order to constrain the number of electrical nets that are created, you could assign unique reference designators to those components that should create electrical nets, or simply [create electrical nets by selecting the components in the designon page 339.](#page-2-0)
- 4. Click **OK**. Electrical nets are regenerated based on the new or changed set of specified refdes prefixes.
- 5. Whenever electrical nets are created, deleted or changed, all electrical nets in the design are regenerated. Verify that the results of an electrical nets action are what you expected by reading the messages in the Output Window.

Rules (min/max length, matched length groups, differential pairs) for electrical nets that are unchanged in the regeneration are kept. Electrical nets that are changed (including changes to the set of components they pass through), or deleted:

- Lose their rules
- Are removed from matched length groups, and
- Diff pairs containing them are removed.

**Results**

Are the results different from what you expected?

- An expected electrical net might have been split or truncated, or not created at all, if it surpassed one of the maximum thresholds set in the Electrical Netson page 1361 dialog box.
- Mixed-method restriction if any of the selected components, or any net attached to a selected component, has been excluded from electrical net creation, it cannot be included in an electrical net. (A component or net is excluded from electrical net creation if its "Create electrical net" and "Allow electrical net creation..." check boxes are both cleared.)

For more information, see the ["Conditions Governing Electrical Net Creation"on page 348](#page-11-0).

## Deletion of Electrical Nets
You can delete electrical nets manually—or automatically, if Ref. Des. Prefix assignment in the Electrical Nets dialog box created them.

[Deleting Electrical Nets Manually](#page-5-1) [Deleting Electrical Nets Automatically](#page-5-2)

### Deleting Electrical Nets Manually
Select electrical nets in the design to delete them.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the workspace, [select the electrical nets on page 345y](#page-8-1)ou want to delete.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Delete Electrical Net** popup menu item. Deleting an electrical net does not delete the physical nets.

**Results**

The Create electrical net check box is cleared for all the nets of the selected electrical nets. If any electrical nets were created by component (including by refdes prefix), for those nets the "Allow electrical net creation by component" check box is cleared as well.

### Deleting Electrical Nets Automatically
You can "automatically" delete a group of electrical nets that the refdes prefix method created automatically.

**Procedure**

- 1. Click the **Setup> Electrical Nets** menu item.
- 2. In the Electrical Netson page 1361 dialog box, delete the refdes prefixes of the associating components.
- 3. Click **OK**.
- 4. Whenever electrical nets are created, deleted or changed, all electrical nets in the design are regenerated. Verify that the results of an electrical nets operation are what you expected by reading the messages in the Output Window.

**Results**

The electrical nets created by components having the specified refdes prefix are deleted, split or truncated.

Are the results different from what you expected? Mixed-method restrictions:

- If a component having the deleted refdes prefix has the "Create electrical net" check box selected, the physical nets will remain in an electrical net.
- If a component having the deleted refdes prefix has the "Allow electrical net creation by refdes prefix and by net" check box selected, and both nets attached to a two-pin component (or to a single gate of a multiple-pin component) have the "Create electrical net" check box selected, those nets will remain in an electrical net.

For more information, see "["Conditions Governing Electrical Net Creation"on page 348](#page-11-0)".

[Excluding Components from Electrical Net Creation](#page-7-0)

## Excluding Nets from Electrical Net Creation
You can exclude individual nets from inclusion in any electrical net.

Clear both the Net Properties "Create electrical net" check box and the "Allow electrical net creation by component" check box, removing the selected nets from any current electrical net, and preventing electrical net creation by component (including by refdes prefix). For more information, see ["Conditions](#page-11-0) [Governing Electrical Net Creation"on page 348.](#page-11-0)

**Procedure**

- 1. In the workspace, select the net(s) you want to exclude from electrical net creation.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Disable Electrical Net Creation** popup menu item. As an alternative, in the Net Properties dialog box, clear both the "Create electrical net" and "Allow electrical net creation by components" check boxes.
- 3. Whenever electrical nets are created, deleted or changed, all electrical nets in the design are regenerated. Verify that the results of an electrical nets operation are what you expected by reading the messages in the Output Window.

**Results**

The selected nets are removed from existing electrical nets, and the Net Properties "Create electrical net" and "Allow electrical net creation by components" check boxes are cleared for all the selected nets.

[Canceling Electrical Net Creation by Nets](#page-7-1)

## Excluding Components from Electrical Net Creation
You can prevent an individual component (a component through which an electrical net passes) from creating electrical nets.

If you exclude a component that is not already part of an electrical net, it cannot become part of an electrical net created by net or by refdes prefix. In addition, if the component is already part of an electrical net, it is removed from the electrical net.

Clear both the Component Properties "Create electrical net" and "Allow electrical net creation..." check boxes, preventing the selected components from creating electrical nets. For more information, see ["Conditions Governing Electrical Net Creation"on page 348](#page-11-0).

**Procedure**

- 1. In the workspace, select the components you want to exclude from electrical nets.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Disable Electrical Net Creation** popup menu item. As an alternative, in the Component Properties Dialog Box, clear both the "Create electrical net" and "Allow electrical net creation by refdes prefix or by net" check boxes.
- 3. The selected components are excluded from electrical net creation. If a component is part of an existing electrical net, it is removed, that is, the electrical net no longer goes through it. Removing a component from an electrical net splits, truncates, or deletes the electrical net, depending upon its configuration and the position of the removed component.
- 4. Whenever electrical nets are created, deleted or changed, all electrical nets in the design are regenerated. Verify that the results of an electrical nets operation are what you expected by reading the messages in the Output Window.

**Results**

Are the results different from what you expected? Nets attached to the excluded component may still be part of an electrical net through other components.

![](/layout/guide/16/_page_8_Picture_1.jpeg)

**Tip** If you want to exclude the nets from electrical nets altogether, also clear the "Allow electrical net creation by components" check box.

4. Whenever electrical nets are created, deleted or changed, all electrical nets in the design are regenerated. Verify that the results of an electrical nets operation are what you expected by reading the messages in the Output Window.

**Results**

Are the results different from what you expected? Mixed-method restriction — nets that are also part of an electrical net by the component and/or the refdes prefix method remain part of an electrical net.

**Related Topics**

[Conditions Governing Electrical Net Creation](#page-11-0)

## Canceling Electrical Net Creation by Components
You can cancel or prevent components from creating an electrical net that passes through them.

**Procedure**

- 1. In the workspace or Project Explorer, select the components whose electrical net creation you want to cancel.
- 2. Right-click and click the **Properties** popup menu item.
- 3. In the Component Properties Dialog Box, in the Electrical Nets area, clear the Create electrical net check box. Electrical net creation by the selected component is canceled.

![](/layout/guide/16/_page_8_Picture_14.jpeg)

**Tip** If you want to exclude the components from electrical nets any method, also clear the "Allow electrical net creation by refdes prefix and nets" check box.

4. Whenever electrical nets are created, deleted or changed, all electrical nets in the design are regenerated. So you should always verify that the results of an electrical nets operation are what you expected by reading the messages in the Output Window.

**Results**

Are the results different from what you expected? Mixed-method restriction — nets that are attached to selected components, and are also part of electrical nets by the net and/or the refdes prefix method remain in the electrical net through the selected components.

## Selecting Electrical Nets

The Default button is unavailable if the selected electrical net has no rules assigned to it. You know you have successfully reset the net rules if the HiSpeed Rules indicator (H) is removed, and the Default button is no longer available.
- 4. Close all rules dialog boxes to return to the design.

## Conditions Governing Electrical Net Creation
You can create electrical nets using one of three methods. To correctly maintain settings, avoid using a mixture of methods.

**Settings That Control Electrical Net Creation**

The following Net Properties dialog boxon page 1487 settings control the creation of electrical nets:

- **Create electrical net check box**  creates electrical nets and is cleared by default for all nets.
- **Allow electrical net creation by components check box**  allows the selected net to be added to an electrical net by other methods, and is selected by default for all nets. So by default, you can create an electrical net by any of the three methods.

The following Component Properties dialog boxon page 1191 settings control the creation of electrical nets:

- **Create electrical net check box**  creates electrical nets, and is cleared by default for all components.
- **Allow electrical net creation by refdes prefix and nets check box**  allows the selected component to be added to an electrical net by other methods, and is selected by default for components. So by default, you can create an electrical net by any of the three methods.

The following "Electrical Nets Dialog Box"on page 1361 Refdes prefixes and settings control the creation of electrical nets:

- **Maximum net count per electrical net value**  default value is 5.
- **Maximum non-plane-net pin count value**  default value is 25. Virtual pins are not included in a net's pin count.

**Conditions Required for Electrical Net Creation**

A discrete component and its attached nets become part of an electrical net only if the following conditions 1 and 2 are true:

- 1. The component and net properties are set so as to meet one of the following conditions:
	- Component Properties "Create electrical net" check box is selected and neither attached net is excluded from electrical net creation. (A component or net is excluded from electrical net creation if its "Create electrical net" and "Allow electrical net creation..." check boxes are both cleared.)
	- Net Properties "Create electrical net" check box is selected for both nets and the component is not excluded from electrical net creation (A component or net is excluded from electrical net creation if its "Create electrical net" and "Allow electrical net creation ..." check boxes are both cleared.)
- Component "Allow electrical net creation..." check box is selected and no attached net is excluded from electrical net creation and the component's refdes prefix is specified in the Electrical Nets dialog box. (A component or net is excluded from electrical net creation if its "Create electrical net" and "Allow electrical net creation..." check boxes are both cleared.)
- 2. The component, its nets, and the potential electrical net it will be a part of, conform to the "Maximum net count per electrical net" and "Maximum non-plane-net pin count" settings in the "Electrical Nets Dialog Box"on page 1361.
