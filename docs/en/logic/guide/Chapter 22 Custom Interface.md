# Chapter 22 Custom Interface  

You can customize the interface of SailWind tools by customizing elements of the interface such as toolbars, menus, and shortcut keys or by customizing the way windows of the interface are displayed.  

Customizing the SailWind Interface Organizing Windows  

# Customizing the SailWind Interface  

You can customize the SailWind interface to suit your work style and design work. You can determine which toolbars are displayed, add items to toolbars and menus, and create custom toolbars, menus and shortcut keys.  

To make customizations, use the Customize dialog box. You can invoke the dialog box in two ways:  

• From the SailWind interface, click the Tools $>$ Customize menu item. All customizations you make are applied to the main view of the SailWind tool. In a window of the interface (for example, the Output Window), right-click and select Customize. You customizations apply only to that window.  

Your customizations are saved with your current workspace so that all of the changes you make to toolbars, menus, and shortcut keys are present when you work in that workspace again.

Hidden Windows   
Detaching Windows From the Current View   
Attach Windows to the Current View   
Embed Windows Within Other Windows   
Managing Window Tabs  

# Showing Windows  

When you first start the application, several windows display. You can show, hide, and automatically hide any of the windows in the application.  

# Procedure  

On the View menu, click the name of the window you want to show.  

Your choices may include Navigation Window, Output Window, Project Explorer, Help Window, Spreadsheet, and Shortcut Dialog.  

# Hidden Windows  

When the application opens, several windows are open in addition to your workspace. You can close some of these windows or hide them automatically to maximize your design space.  

Closing Windows Hiding Windows Automatically  

# Closing Windows  

If you do not want a particular window to appear in the workspace, you can hide windows by closing them manually.  

# Procedure  

1. Move your pointer to the title bar of the window you want to hide.   
2. Click the small downward pointing arrow  on the right side of the window's title bar.   
3. In the resulting menu, click Hide. The window closes.  

# Hiding Windows Automatically  

You can also set a window to hide automatically so that it appears when you hover the pointer near it, and automatically minimizes when you move the pointer away from it.  

# Procedure  

1. Move your pointer to the right side of the title bar in the window you want to hide.   
2. Click the thumbtack I in the window's title bar.  

The thumbtack picture changes to point sideways . A new bar appears on the side of the interface. The side on which the bar appears depends on the location of the window. For example, if the Project Explorer is located on the left side of the user interface, when you click the Auto Hide setting from the menu, the new bar appears on the left side of the interface.  

The new bar contains a tab that has the same name as the window.  

3. Hover over the tab in the new bar. The window reappears, covering the application.  

4. Move the pointer away from the window. The window minimizes to a tab.  

# 0 Tip  

To turn off the Auto Hide feature, hover over the tab in the new bar so the window reappears. Then repeat steps 1-2 in reverse.  

# Detaching Windows From the Current View  

You can detach a window from the current view. This is called floating. A floating window is not attached to the current view; instead, it hovers, blocking the view to anything below it.  

# Restrictions and Limitations  

You cannot float a window that is currently set to hide automatically. Turn off the Auto Hide feature before floating a window.  

# Procedure  

Double-click the window's title bar. The window detaches and you can move it to any part of the screen.  

![](images/04bc166e8ce0b7860a804a7c7827d66fd8d3a7caddc342be735804b017531323.jpg)  

# Tip  

To undo the floating, see Attach Windows to the Current View.  

# Attach Windows to the Current View  

You can attach a window to the current view. This is called docking. A docked window is attached to the current view, and therefore does not block the view to anything below it. You can dock a window in its last docked location, or dock a window to a different location.  

Docking to the Last Location Docking to a New Location  

# Docking to the Last Location  

If you have moved a window, you can use a title bar keystroke command to dock it to its last docked location.  

# Procedure  

Double-click the window's title bar. The window reattaches to the interface.  

# Docking to a New Location  

You can use a drag operation to dock a window to a new location.  

# Procedure  

1. Using the title bar, drag the window.  

When you start dragging the window, additional graphics appear in the user interface. At the edges of the user interface, arrows containing graphics appear, as shown in Figure 7:

Tip   
A similar group of arrows appears in a group near the center of the screen. Ignore that group of arrows for this procedure.  

2. While dragging the window, hover over one of the arrows on the edge of the user interface. For example, hover over the arrow on the left side of the user interface.  

A transparent colored block appears along the side of the user interface to which you are pointing. This block indicates where the window will be docked when you release the mouse button. For example, if you hover over the arrow on the left side of the user interface, a block appears along the left side of the screen, as shown in Figure 8.

The window docks to the user interface, and the other windows in the user interface resize.  

# Embed Windows Within Other Windows  

In addition to attaching a window to a side of the user interface, you can embed a window within another window, so that it shares the window space with the original window, or becomes a tab within the original window.  

Two Windows Sharing One Window Space Creating Tabs Within Windows  

# Two Windows Sharing One Window Space  

Use a drag operation to embed a window and share another window's space.  

# Procedure  

1. Using the title bar, drag a window into another window.  

When you start dragging a window, additional graphics appear in the user interface. A group of arrows containing graphics appears in the center of the window you are dragging, as shown in Figure 9. Depending on the window you are dragging, the group of arrows may also have a tab graphic in the center.

# Managing Window Tabs  

Some of the windows in the user interface contain tabs. However, you may decide you do not like the organization or grouping of the tabs. You can create additional tabs by embedding windows within other windows.  

For more information, see “Embed Windows Within Other Windows” on page 419  

Rearranging Tabs in a Window Moving Tabs Between Windows Converting Tabs to Windows  

# Rearranging Tabs in a Window  

You can only rearrange tabs that you created by embedding a window within one of the docking windows.   
You cannot rearrange regular tabs, such as those in the Output window.  

# Procedure  

Drag the tab to a new position within the row of tabs.  

# Moving Tabs Between Windows  

You can only move tabs that you have embedded in other windows. In windows that have tabs by default (such as the Output Window in SailWind Router), you cannot move the tabs. You can only rearrange them. For information on rearranging tabs, see the previous section.  

See also “Embed Windows Within Other Windows” on page 419.  

# Procedure  

1. Drag the tab to a new window. When you start dragging, the tab automatically behaves like a window.   
2. Place the tab as you would a window. See also “Organizing Windows” on page 414.  

# Converting Tabs to Windows  

You can use a drag operation to create a new window from a tab.  

# Procedure  

1. Drag the tab. When you start dragging, the tab automatically behaves like a window.   
2. Release the mouse button. Make sure the pointer is not over any arrow graphics. You now have a floating window.  

3. Place the tab as you would any floating window. See also “Organizing Windows” on page 414.
